# Projects

This repository contains projects and tasks completed during my web development internship. Throughout the internship, I worked on building and styling web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I gained hands-on experience creating responsive forms, linking web pages, and implementing basic frontend functionalities.

The projects reflect foundational web development skills and demonstrate my learning progress in both frontend and backend concepts.
